	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p>Welcome to my site and blog! I'm a front end consultant at <a href="http://improving.com">Improving
	Columbus</a>, an amateur poet and philosopher, and most importantly a devoted and happy husband.</p>
	
	<p>I specialize in JavaScript, but I'm fluent in most popular web languages, including HTML5, CSS3, SASS,
	PHP, Python, and Ruby. My favorite development tool is currently <a href="http://reactjs.org">React</a>,
	and I love testing out any new library that makes developer's lives easier.</p>
	
	<p>I'm passionate for open source projects, and I'm happy to contribute especially to the documentation
	on any projects. If you need someone to copy-edit, refactor, or even write your documentation,
	<a href="#">let me know!</a></p>
	
	<p>I have a Masters degree in philosophy from Fordham University. Although my philosophical interests are
	broad, my work mostly focuses on the <a href="http://philpapers.org/browse/epistemology-of-disagreement/">
	epistemology of disagreement</a>. I'm currently working out how the canonical results in this area of
	philosophy can guide our decision making when we encounter disagreement within an agile environment. I
	also am interested in conceptual analysis, both within the development world and more broadly.</p>

	<p>Want to know more about me? <a href="#">Contact me</a> - I'm happy to chat programming, philosophy, or
	theology.</p>
