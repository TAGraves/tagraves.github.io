It's like a beautiful coincidence.  
And yet we swore  
that it didn't make sense  
at all.  

Three hundred thirty six miles I drove;  
Manchester's Orchestra kept me on the road,  
and I hoped if you looked me in the eyes  
you'd not say no.  

You’re the queen  
in our kingdom’s cathedral.  
I’m no king,  
but I mean well.  

I took this Rose and held it all too tight.  
Well, I felt perfect every single night,  
until you told me  
“you hold me down."  

For a time we lived in ecstasy,  
had the impression that you’d never leave,  
and when you did,  
that you’d come back to me.  

I'm the king  
in my crumbling kingdom.  
You escaped  
when the ground started rumbling.  

I hope you'll call me at a quarter to nine.  
There is no longer any doubt in my mind:  
if I could see your face and hear your voice  
I'd know I'll be fine.  

I claim to know of resurrection still,  
and so I hope and pray to God you will  
restore  
what it was before.  

We’d be there  
in that imperfect kingdom.  
I’ll hold on  
Until the day when you come.
