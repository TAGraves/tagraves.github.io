Conciliationism is often motivated by appealing to intuitive cases.
I argue that this is a mistake and obscures the real commitments of
the conciliationist. Instead, I motivate conciliationism by appealing
to a plausible picture of belief formation and four intuitive principles:
the Independence Principle, the Enkratic Principle, the Equal
Weight View, and the Opaque Evidence Principle. I see three upshots
to this approach. First, it clarifies the nature of conciliationism and
shows that it is not committed to, for example, the Uniqueness Thesis.
Second, it clarifies the positions of the opponents of conciliationism.
Third, it easily incorporates non-ideal cases, such as cases where interlocutors
are not peers.
